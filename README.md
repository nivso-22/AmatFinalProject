essentialy, it's like desmos.com but bad.

You will need to install the matpltlib package for this to run.

select the type of equation and the range and press graph.
(note: the graphs won't delete themselves)


if you want to send someone you graph, select export and name it however you like.
if you got sent a graph select import and write the path of the file.

currently setup doesnt work so just paste these commands into the commandline:
pip install matplotlib
pip install custom tkinter
